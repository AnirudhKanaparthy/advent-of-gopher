# Advent of Gopher
Advent of Code is a set of Christmas themed coding challenges. It has become a well known set of challenges which developers all around the globe try to solve around Christmas time. Some use these challenges to pick up a new language as it forces you to figure out basic operations done is programming in general like reading a file.

I made this with the goal of becoming fluent in Golang. My goal is to be able to solve as many problems in Advent of Code and start thinking in Golang. Whenever I finish reading a question I should be able to quickly piece together how to express the solution in Go.
